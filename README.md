[Threema announced a desktop client][0] and I wanted to have a way to test it on
my local machine. As I'm a big fan of [Docker][1] I created this simple *Dockerfile*
which installs *v1.1.0* using [NodeJS][2] *v7.5.0*.

**Attention** This *Dockerfile* is **NOT MEANT FOR PRODUCTION** so don't use it 
for critical communication that you need to be secure!
